            <h4>World War I</h4>
            <p>
              For four years, from 1914 to 1918, World War I raged across
              Europe's western and eastern fronts after growing tensions and
              then the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria
              ignited the war. Trench warfare and the early use of tanks,
              submarines and airplanes meant the warâ€™s battles were
              devastatingly bloody, claiming an estimated 40 million military
              and civilian casualties, including 20 million deaths. Fighting
              under brutal conditions, World War I battles on both land and at
              sea saw mass carnage, but few decisive victories, with some
              conflicts waging for months on end.

            <h4>World War II</h4>
            <p>
              With Adolf Hitler leading a German invasion of Poland in 1939,
              World War II was launched, a deadly global conflict waged across
              Europe and the Pacific until 1945. Bloody battles raged between
              the Allied powers, which included Britain, France, the Soviet
              Union and the United States, along with other nations, and the
              Axis, notably Germany and Japan. When the Axis ultimately
              surrendered, some 20 million soldiers were dead, along with an
              estimated 40 million civilians. Below is a timeline of the war's
              most significant battles.
